# local-search-engine-for-pdf-and-images (QLen)
This is a personal proof-of-concept project developed in the summer following my first year as a CS student. The application is a local search engine with a graphical UI that allows users to search across PDFs and image files, edit metadata, and manage large-scale file databases efficiently.
